## ***Task List***
- [ ] Find Arduino! (Currently missing... oof)
- [ ] Test Program
- [ ] Update Schematic


## Welcome!
Keep It Simple... Silly! When the days start to blur together, use this 
Arduino code to help spice up life! Especially during this trying time
in the middle of COVID, why not let something else give you some ideas
for something to do during the day? With just under 100 activities and 
101 greetings, this system will hopefully help give your day some extra
flare!


## How Well Does This Work?
I'm not sure yet! Once I find my Arduino, I'll test out this program
to see how well it suggests daily activities! The general idea though 
is that every 24 hours, the Arduino will randomly select a greeting or 
a suggested activity to display. I suggest starting the system sometime 
at night before your usual bedtime, so that your new activity or
greeting can be ready well before you wake up! If the given activity
doesn't apply to you, or is something you've done recently, you can
always "re-roll" for a new activity or greeting. If something goes
wrong (power outage) you can always unplug/plug it back in or press
the *other* button to reset the system at the desired time. Enjoy!


## What Do I Need?
Required Components:
  - Liquid Crystal Display (LCD)
Optional Components:
  - 2 LEDs (Any Color)
    - 1 for use as an "Online" indicator (Preferrably Green)
    - 1 for use as a "Processing" indicator (Preferrably Red)
  - 2 Buttons
    - 1 to reload system (A)
    - 1 to "re-roll" activity/greeting (B)
